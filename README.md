# 📜 **SOLSEC: Smart Contract Auditor**  

**SOLSEC** is a powerful tool designed to **analyze Solidity smart contracts** for vulnerabilities using **Slither** and provide AI-powered insights via **LangChain**. With an easy-to-use interface built with **Tailwind CSS & DaisyUI**, this tool helps developers detect security issues in their contracts before they can be exploited.

## **Why is this Important?**  

Every year, **millions of dollars** are stolen from crypto wallets due to security vulnerabilities in smart contracts. Issues like **reentrancy attacks, integer overflows, and access control flaws** have led to devastating hacks.  

###  **Some Notorious Hacks Due to Vulnerabilities**  
- **The DAO Hack (2016) - $60M+ stolen** due to a reentrancy vulnerability.  
- **Poly Network Hack (2021) - $600M stolen** due to improper access control.  
- **Nomad Bridge Hack (2022) - $190M lost** due to a simple initialization bug.  

 **To prevent such attacks**, I created this Smart Contract Auditor, allowing developers to scan their Solidity contracts **before deploying them on the blockchain**.

##  **How it Works**  

1. **Upload a Solidity smart contract (.sol file).**  
2. **Slither scans the contract** for vulnerabilities like:  
   - Reentrancy  
   - Integer Overflow/Underflow  
   - Unchecked External Calls  
   - Uninitialized Storage Variables  
3. **The AI Chatbot (LangChain) explains the vulnerabilities** and suggests fixes.  
4. **Secure your smart contract before deploying it!**  

##  **How to Use**
